## 🔒 Security & Performance

We have implemented rigorous security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of the platform.

### Enhanced Security Headers
-   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Strict, nonce-based CSP to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Enforces secure HTTPS connections.
-   **X-Frame-Options:** set to `DENY` to prevent clickjacking.
-   **X-Content-Type-Options:** `nosniff` to prevent MIME-sniffing attacks.
-   **Referrer-Policy:** `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to protect user privacy.
-   **Permissions-Policy:** Explicitly disables sensitive features like camera, microphone, and geolocation.

### Advanced Protection and Obfuscation
-   **Bot Detection:** Intelligent middleware identifies legitimate search engine bots versus potential scrapers, applying optimized caching strategies for each.
-   **Server Obfuscation:** Custom `Server: JHL-Web-Engine` and `X-Powered-By: Elite-Tech` headers mask the underlying infrastructure to reduce attack surface mapping.
-   **Input Sanitization:** Robust validation to prevent injection attacks.
